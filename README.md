"Most people struggle with deciding where they should go eat lunch. Our application, iHangry, aims to please those who are indecisive in choosing a restaurant when they are hungry. Our application will be a website where hungry users can quickly see a restaurant that is nearby that will fulfill their hunger needs. If the user doesn’t feel like eating at that location, they will be able to easily generate a new place with the click of a button and hopefully will discover local restaurants they haven’t tried before."
